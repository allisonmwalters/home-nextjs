            Hi, I&apos;m a person who makes things and loves people. I am the webmaster of CAA | Advancing Art &amp; Design. I write science fiction, paint, draw, do photography, make videos, write poetry, and DJ in my spare time. I like creating ideas and objects. Sometimes I also help as a sci-fi copy editor or as an artist assistant. I have a black cat named Steven and an orange cat named Texas Pete.</p>
